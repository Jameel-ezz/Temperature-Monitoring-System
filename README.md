# TemperatureMonitoringSystem
 The provided code represents a temperature monitoring system based on a microcontroller, equipped with a keypad and an LCD display. The system is designed to read temperature values from multiple channels using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and display the results on an LCD screen. It also provides functionality to calculate and display the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures among the readings.

The code displays the calculated average and maximum and minimum temperatures on the top line of the LCD display. It prompts the user to select a channel (1 to 8) using the keypad to view the corresponding temperature reading. Once the user selects a channel, the temperature reading for that channel is displayed on the second line of the LCD display.

Overall, the code creates a temperature monitoring system that can read and display temperature values from multiple channels using an ADC, while providing options to calculate and display statistics such as maximum, minimum, and average temperatures. The system's keypad interface and LCD display make it user-friendly and suitable for temperature monitoring applications.
